# Pancreatic-cancer-Analysis-using-Gene-Expression-data
- Pancreatic cancer is the tenth most common cancer in men and the ninth most common in women, but it is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths, being responsible for 8% of all cancer-related deaths.
- Approximately 75% of all pancreatic carcinomas occur within the head or neck of the pancreas, 15-20% occur in the body of the pancreas, and 5-10% occur in the tail. 
- In this Study we are going to analyse the data by using Exploratory data analysis and Visualise the data using PCA.

# Dataset Description
- Data is stored in GCT (Gene Cluster text) format & we are going to analze it using PCA plots and GSVA Algorithms

# Approach of Analysis
- Understanding the Objectives
- Data Collection
- Importing Dependencies
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visulization after PCA
